                <p>Eccentric. Innovative. Prolific in his work. Architect and Interior Design Hall of Famer Edward A.
                    Feiner
                    died earlier this week after battling brain cancer. He is remembered for his outsized
                    achievementsâ€”and
                    personality.

                    During his tenure as chief architect of the U.S. General Services Administration, Feiner ushered in
                    a
                    new
                    era of design for federal landmarks by creating the Design Excellence Program. The program, which he
                    developed with colleague Marilyn Farley, ensured that architects for government projects were
                    carefully
                    vetted by experts in the field, creating a new legacy of iconic design. From courthouses to
                    high-tech
                    labs,
                    Feiner worked with the likes of David Childs, Henry Cobb, James Freed and countless others to bring
                    more
                    than 140 federal buildings to life. Known for championing diversity, he also commissioned the first
                    federal
                    courthouse by a Black architect, Ralph Jackson, and the first federal building by a woman, Carol
                    Ross
                    Barney.</p>
